This project focuses on lane detection using a hybrid model that combines the Swin Transformer and CNN-SCNN architectures. The model leverages the strengths of both architectures to achieve high accuracy in lane detection. It demonstrates strong performance on two datasets: TuSimple and BDD100K. The model achieves an F1 score of 98.23 on the TuSimple dataset and an accuracy of 98.8 with an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 36.5 on the BDD100K dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world lane detection tasks.
